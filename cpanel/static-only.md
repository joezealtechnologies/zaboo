# 🌐 **Static-Only Deployment (No Backend)**

If your cPanel hosting doesn't support Node.js, you can still deploy the frontend as a static website.

## 📋 **What Works Without Backend**

✅ **Working Features:**
- Main website display
- Vehicle showcase
- Image galleries
- Contact form (opens email client)
- Responsive design
- All animations and interactions

❌ **Not Working:**
- Admin panel
- Dynamic vehicle management
- Image uploads
- Database-driven content

---

## 🚀 **Static Deployment Steps**

### **1. Build for Static Hosting**
```bash
npm run build
```

### **2. Upload to cPanel**
Upload these files to `public_html/`:
- All contents of `dist/` folder
- Copy `public/fazona/` to `public_html/fazona/`
- Upload `cpanel/.htaccess`

### **3. File Structure**
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── assets/
├── fazona/
└── .htaccess
```

### **4. Test Website**
Visit `https://fazona.org` - your website should work perfectly!

## 🔧 **For Full Functionality**

To get the admin panel working, you'll need:

### **Option 1: Upgrade Hosting**
- Contact your provider about Node.js support
- Upgrade to a plan that includes Node.js

### **Option 2: Hybrid Setup**
- Frontend on cPanel (static)
- Backend on separate service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)

### **Option 3: Different Hosting**
- Move to hosting that supports Node.js
- Examples: DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc.

## 💡 **Recommendation**

For a business website like FaZona EV, I recommend getting hosting that supports Node.js so you can:
- Manage vehicles through admin panel
- Upload new vehicle images
- Update content dynamically
- Have full control over your website

**Your static website will still look amazing and professional!** 🚗⚡
